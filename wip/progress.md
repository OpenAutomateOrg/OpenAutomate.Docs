## Known Issues
### Critical
- Database schema needs updates for tenant fields and relationships
- Authentication flow needs to include tenant context
- Tenant isolation testing needed to ensure data security

### Non-Critical
- Need to determine logging strategy with tenant context
- Need to plan test coverage approach for tenant isolation
- Performance impact of tenant filtering needs monitoring

## Testing Status
### Completed Tests
- Basic project structure validation

### Pending Tests
- Unit tests for tenant resolution middleware
- Unit tests for tenant context service
- API endpoint tests with tenant isolation
- Repository pattern tests with tenant filtering
- Authentication flow tests with tenant context
- Integration tests for multi-tenant workflows

## Documentation Status
