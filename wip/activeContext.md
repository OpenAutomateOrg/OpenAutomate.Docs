# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on developing the backend API for the OpenAutomate platform as a multi-tenant system. This includes setting up the ASP.NET Core project structure, implementing core entities with tenant isolation, and establishing the repository pattern for data access with tenant filtering. A comprehensive task breakdown has been created to guide the development process. The authentication system will implement JWT with refresh token support for enhanced security.

## Recent Changes
### April 3, 2025
- Created technical design document outlining the system architecture and components
- Generated comprehensive task breakdown for project implementation
- Updated memory bank with project requirements and plans
- Decided to implement refresh token authentication for improved security
- Adopted multi-tenant architecture with path-based tenant resolution

### April 2, 2025
- Created initial project structure with OpenAutomate.API, OpenAutomate.Core, and OpenAutomate.Infrastructure projects
- Set up repository in GitHub for version control
- Initialized backend solution structure

## Next Steps
1. Implement multi-tenant architecture and tenant resolution middleware
2. Enhance entity models with tenant (Organization) references
3. Implement tenant context for maintaining tenant state
4. Update database context with global query filters for tenant isolation
5. Complete project setup and infrastructure configuration
6. Define core domain entities (User, BotAgent, Package, etc.) including RefreshToken
7. Set up database context and migrations
8. Implement repository pattern for data access with tenant awareness
9. Create token service with refresh token support
10. Create initial API endpoints for authentication and bot agent registration

## Active Decisions
### Multi-Tenant Architecture Approach
- Context: Need to implement multi-tenancy for the platform
- Options:
  - Database per tenant
  - Schema per tenant
  - Shared database with tenant filtering
- Status: Decision made to use shared database with tenant filtering for simpler management and better resource utilization

### Tenant Identification Strategy
- Context: Need to determine how tenants are identified in requests
- Options:
  - Subdomain-based (tenant.domain.com)
  - Path-based (domain.com/tenant)
  - Header-based (X-Tenant header)
- Status: Decision made to use path-based tenant identification for better URL readability and compatibility

### Database Provider
- Context: Need to select a database provider for the project
- Options: 
  - SQL Server (familiar, good tooling support)
  - PostgreSQL (open-source, cross-platform)
- Status: Under consideration, leaning toward PostgreSQL for cross-platform support

### Authentication Mechanism
- Context: Need to implement secure authentication for API access
- Options:
  - Basic JWT authentication
  - JWT with refresh token mechanism
  - OAuth 2.0 with identity provider
- Status: Decision made to use JWT with refresh tokens for enhanced security and user experience

### Project Task Management
- Context: Need an approach to track and manage project tasks
- Options:
  - Use GitHub Issues and Projects
  - Use external task management tool
  - Use the task breakdown document
- Status: Decision made to use GitHub Issues with the task breakdown as a reference

## Current Considerations
- How to structure the automation package format for maximum flexibility
- Best approach for secure distribution of packages to bot agents
- Real-time monitoring implementation using SignalR
- Scheduling mechanism for recurring automation tasks
- Multi-environment support (dev, test, production)
- Initial priority of tasks from the breakdown for MVP development
- Secure storage of refresh tokens in the database
- Token rotation and revocation strategies
- Tenant data isolation enforcement across the application
- Cross-tenant operations for system administrators
- URL structure and routing for tenant-specific resources
- Performance impact of tenant filtering on queries

## Blockers
- Need to finalize database schema design with tenant references
- Need to define exact communication protocol between API and bot agents
- Need to determine deployment strategy for bot agents
- Need to implement tenant resolution middleware

## Dependencies
- Completion of core domain model with tenant awareness
- Frontend development plan with tenant-specific routing
- Bot agent communication protocol specification
- Authentication flow implementation with refresh tokens
- Tenant context implementation for data isolation
