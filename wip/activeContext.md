# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on developing the backend API for the OpenAutomate platform. This includes setting up the ASP.NET Core project structure, implementing core entities, and establishing the repository pattern for data access. A comprehensive task breakdown has been created to guide the development process.

## Recent Changes
### April 3, 2023
- Created technical design document outlining the system architecture and components
- Generated comprehensive task breakdown for project implementation
- Updated memory bank with project requirements and plans

### April 2, 2023
- Created initial project structure with OpenAutomate.API, OpenAutomate.Core, and OpenAutomate.Infrastructure projects
- Set up repository in GitHub for version control
- Initialized backend solution structure

## Next Steps
1. Complete project setup and infrastructure configuration
2. Define core domain entities (User, BotAgent, Package, etc.)
3. Set up database context and migrations
4. Implement repository pattern for data access
5. Create initial API endpoints for authentication and bot agent registration

## Active Decisions
### Database Provider
- Context: Need to select a database provider for the project
- Options: 
  - SQL Server (familiar, good tooling support)
  - PostgreSQL (open-source, cross-platform)
- Status: Under consideration, leaning toward PostgreSQL for cross-platform support

### Authentication Mechanism
- Context: Need to implement secure authentication for API access
- Options:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - OAuth 2.0 with identity provider
- Status: Decision made to use JWT for simplicity in initial implementation

### Project Task Management
- Context: Need an approach to track and manage project tasks
- Options:
  - Use GitHub Issues and Projects
  - Use external task management tool
  - Use the task breakdown document
- Status: Decision made to use GitHub Issues with the task breakdown as a reference

## Current Considerations
- How to structure the automation package format for maximum flexibility
- Best approach for secure distribution of packages to bot agents
- Real-time monitoring implementation using SignalR
- Scheduling mechanism for recurring automation tasks
- Multi-environment support (dev, test, production)
- Initial priority of tasks from the breakdown for MVP development

## Blockers
- Need to finalize database schema design
- Need to define exact communication protocol between API and bot agents
- Need to determine deployment strategy for bot agents

## Dependencies
- Completion of core domain model
- Frontend development plan
- Bot agent communication protocol specification
