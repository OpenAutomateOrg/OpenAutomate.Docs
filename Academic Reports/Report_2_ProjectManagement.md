  - `feature/*`: Feature branches
  - `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
  - `release/*`: Release preparation branches
  - `hotfix/*`: Production hotfix branches
- Pull Request (PR) workflow:
  1. Developer creates feature/bugfix branch
  2. Developer implements changes and tests
  3. Developer creates PR to develop branch
  4. Automated checks run (CI pipeline)
  5. Code review by at least one other developer
  6. Changes made based on feedback
  7. Final approval and merge
