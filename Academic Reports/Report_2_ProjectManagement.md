# OpenAutomate Project Management Approach

## 2. Management Approach

### 2.1 Project Process

The OpenAutomate project will follow an Agile Scrum methodology with elements of DevOps practices to ensure continuous integration and delivery. This approach allows for iterative development, regular feedback, and adaptation to changing requirements.

```

**Process Description:**

1. **Project Initialization (2 weeks)**
   - Requirements gathering and analysis
   - Project planning and scheduling
   - Setting up development environment and infrastructure
   - Architectural design

2. **7 Sprint Cycles (2 weeks each)**
   - **Sprint Planning**: Prioritizing backlog items, defining sprint goals
   - **Sprint Development**: Coding, testing, documentation
   - **Daily Stand-up**: 15-minute meetings to synchronize work and address impediments
   - **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Automated building, testing, and deployment
   - **Sprint Review/Demo**: Demonstrating completed features to stakeholders
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflecting on what went well and what could be improved

3. **Project Closure (1 week)**
   - Final system testing
   - Documentation completion
   - Knowledge transfer
   - Release planning

**Key Practices:**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) for core components
- Pair programming for complex features
- Continuous code reviews
- Regular refactoring to manage technical debt
- Feature toggles for safe production deployments

### 2.2 Quality Management

The OpenAutomate project will implement a comprehensive quality management strategy to ensure the delivery of a reliable, secure, and high-performance multi-tenant platform.

#### Defect Prevention
- **Architecture Reviews**: Weekly reviews of architectural decisions and implementations
- **Code Style Guidelines**: Implementation of .NET and React coding standards
- **Automated Code Analysis**: Use of static code analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint)
- **Definition of Done**: Clear criteria for feature completion including security and performance
- **Checklists**: Task-specific checklists for common sources of defects

#### Reviewing
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review for all code changes
- **Security Reviews**: Dedicated security reviews for authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation
- **Documentation Reviews**: Regular reviews of technical and user documentation
- **Design Reviews**: UI/UX reviews before implementation

#### Unit Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% unit test coverage for core components
- **Unit Test Automation**: Automated test execution on each commit
- **Mock Objects**: Use of mock objects for testing components in isolation
- **Test-Driven Development**: TDD approach for critical components
- **Boundary Testing**: Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions

#### Integration Testing
- **API Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all API endpoints
- **Cross-Component Testing**: Testing interactions between different components
- **Tenant Isolation Testing**: Verification of tenant data isolation
- **Authentication Flow Testing**: Validation of all authentication scenarios
- **Database Integration Testing**: Testing of database operations and migrations

#### System Testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing of the system
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and security vulnerability scanning
- **Compatibility Testing**: Testing across different browsers and devices
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluation of user interface and experience

#### Acceptance Testing
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Validation against user requirements
- **Stakeholder Demos**: Regular demonstrations to stakeholders
- **Beta Testing**: Limited release to selected users for feedback
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring new features don't break existing functionality

## 6. Configuration Management

### 6.1 Document Management

- All project documentation will be stored in the OpenAutomate.Docs GitHub repository
- Documents will follow a clear naming convention: `[Category]-[Name]-[Version].md`
- Version control will be maintained through Git, with meaningful commit messages
- Major document versions will be tagged with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0)
- Document review and approval process:
  1. Author creates document and submits PR
  2. Designated reviewers provide feedback
  3. Author addresses feedback
  4. Final approval by project lead
  5. Merge to main branch
- Change tracking will be maintained in a changelog section for each document
- Documents will be in Markdown format for easy viewing in GitHub
- Sensitive documentation (credentials, security details) will be stored separately with restricted access

### 6.2 Source Code Management

- Source code will be managed using Git and GitHub across multiple repositories:
  - OpenAutomate.Backend
  - OpenAutomate.Frontend
  - OpenAutomate.BotAgent
  - OpenAutomate.Docs
- Branch strategy:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `development`: Integration branch for next release
  - `feature/*`: Feature branches
  - `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
  - `release/*`: Release preparation branches
  - `hotfix/*`: Production hotfix branches
- Pull Request (PR) workflow:
  1. Developer creates feature/bugfix branch
  2. Developer implements changes and tests
  3. Developer creates PR to develop branch
  4. Automated checks run (CI pipeline)
  5. Code review by at least one other developer
  6. Changes made based on feedback
  7. Final approval and merge
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for releases
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for build, test, and deployment
- Protected branches requiring PR approvals and passing CI checks
- Conventional commit message format for better changelog generation
