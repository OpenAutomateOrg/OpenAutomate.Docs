### Worker Service
- Status: ðŸ“… Planned
- Description: Background service for schedule processing and automation execution
- Dependencies: Multi-tenant core domain models, API endpoints for triggering executions

## Known Issues
### Critical
- Need to fix the token refresh error occurring immediately after login
- Need to implement token cleanup to prevent database growth from expired tokens
- Need to optimize database queries with proper indexing for token lookups
- Need to address potential redundancy in entity properties (e.g., Created vs. CreateAt)

### Non-Critical
- Need to determine logging strategy with tenant context
- Need to plan test coverage approach for tenant isolation
- Performance impact of tenant filtering needs monitoring
- Need to standardize error handling across the application

## Testing Status
### Completed Tests
- Basic project structure validation
- Manual testing of authentication flow
- Manual testing of frontend auth provider implementation
- Manual testing of token refresh functionality
